        <h1>Protoculture</h1>

        <p>This is a complete web site, powered entirely by <a href="http://github.com/atrauzzi/protoculture">protoculture</a>!</p>

        <p>
            Both the front and the back end make use of the full protoculture framework for bootstrap and dependency injection.
            Additionally, any front-end functionality is configured and built by-convention using webpack!
